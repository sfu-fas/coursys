  <p> This form is based on the form in Appendix C of the <a href="{{tssu_link}}" target="_new">TSSU's collective agreement.</a></p>
  <p> To compensate for all statutory holidays which may occur in a semester, the total workload required will be reduced by 1.1 hour(s) for each base unit assigned excluding the additional 0.17 B.U. for preparation, e.g. 4.4 hours reduction for 4.17 B.U. appointment.</p>
  <p> The Course instructor shall complete these forms during the first week of classes each semester in consultation with the Teaching Assistant. The Teaching Assistant is entitled to suggest amendments to the assigned times for the various activities. </p>
  <p> All TA assignments will be reviewed by the Course instructor to assess that the workload will not by semester end, exceed the maximum hours of work provided as follows:</p>
  <p> a. Prior to the end of week six (6), Departments shall remind Course instructors and Teaching Assistants that Course instructors are required to conduct a workload review.</p>
  <p> b. The Course instructor will conduct the workload review in consultation with the Teaching Assistant in a timely manner so as to ensure that the course is sufficiently advanced to assess the workload. The Course instructor will advise the Teaching Assistant of the result of the review, and the Department will retain the copy of the completed review form until the conclusion of the following semester.</p>
  <p>Where the Course instructor concludes that the workload required will, by semester end, exceed the total workload hours of the appointment, then it will be necessary to either reduce the workload, where possible, or provide additional compensation.</p>
