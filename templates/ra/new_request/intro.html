                <b>Definition:</b><br>Research Assistants who assist in completing the tasks necessary for the Hiring Supervisor’s research program and/or towards the research group’s general academic deliverables. There is an employer/employee relationship and expectations. Tasks are directed and defined by the Hiring Supervisor and may be broad in range, degree of expertise and complexity.

                <b>Definition:</b><br>A “true scholarship” student is provided with funds from the faculty member’s grant(s) to support the student financially while the student is engaged in the student’s own academic pursuits.  In this case: <br>
                - The student’s research activities are primarily self-directed by the student, with advice and guidance from the student’s faculty supervisor. <br>
                - The student is required to be registered as a student, to be and remain in good academic standing, and to make satisfactory academic progress.  As part of the student’s education in the student’s academic discipline, the student may be required to engage in specific research, research-related, or other educational activities that form a material component of a student’s academic program and progress.<br>
                - The student cannot be “terminated”.  The student’s performance may only be evaluated through normal academic processes and progression. <br>
                Earnings are considered scholarship funding and students will receive a T4A tax form.
