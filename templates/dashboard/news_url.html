Activating the external news feed may cause privacy concerns.  You will be given a URL that can be used to access your personalized news feed.  Please note that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The generated URL will contain a long string of random characters that would be essentially impossible to guess.</li>
<li>This URL can be <strong>accessed with no further authentication</strong> (username or password).  It is your responsibility to keep this URL private.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful with social networking features</strong> (like Google Reader's ability to &ldquo;share&rdquo; news stories).  These will reveal the details of your feed and likely give others the information they need to view any of your news stories.</li>
<li>Your feed can be deactivated or be moved to a different URL at any time.</li>
</ul>
