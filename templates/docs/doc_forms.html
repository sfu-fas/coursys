    <p>Forms are an extremely powerful tool that allow you to have fairly complicated workflows if needed.  As such,
    there are a few inter-related parts that one needs to know about to use them properly.</p>

    <h2 id="formgroups">Form Groups</h2>
    <p>Every form belongs to a <dfn>form group</dfn>. Form groups are made up of specific users.  The people in the
        form group can manage all forms that belong to the form group. A form group may own multiple forms, and a
    person can belong to multiple form groups.</p>
    <h3>Creating/Editing Form Groups</h3>
    <p>If you have the correct permissions, you can find the link to manage form groups off the
        <a href="{% url "onlineforms:index" %}" target="_blank">main online forms page</a>. If not, your local
    Departmental Administrator will have to assign you the <dfn>Form Administrator</dfn> role.</p>
    <img src="/static/images/forms/formgroups.png"/>
    <p>Once <a href="{% url "onlineforms:manage_groups" %}" target="_blank">there</a>, you can either add a new form
    group, or edit any of the form groups in the unit(s) you manage.</p>
    <img src="/static/images/forms/formgroups2.png"/>
    <h3>Adding/Removing people to Form Groups</h3>
    <p>You should <em>only</em> add people in the form group which you want to be able to actually manage the forms
    which the group owns.  Regular users who may have <dfn>sheets</dfn> assigned to them do not need to be in the form
    group.  More on sheets later.</p>
    <p>Add the person you want (1), then select whether or not you want that person to automatically get an email
    whenever a form owned by this form group is submitted (2).  If you do not check this box, the person will still be
    able to manage all forms owned by the group, but they won't automatically be emailed.  If we contrast this to a
    paper form, only the people who may actually be the first people to receive the form should have the automatic
    email option enabled.</p>

    <h2 id="forms">Forms and Sheets</h2>
    <p><dfn>Forms</dfn> are made up of one or more <dfn>sheets</dfn>.  The only sheet that is a little special is the
    <dfn>initial sheet</dfn>, which is the very first one in the form, and the ones people submitting the form fill
    out.</p>
    <p>All other sheets can be assigned to other users.  It may be easier to think of them as replacing actual
    sheets of paper.  You can assign a copy of a certain sheet to multiple users, and each one gets their own copy to
    fill out.  You can be waiting for multiple sheets from multiple users, and still be assigning more sheets.</p>
    <h3>Creating/Editing Forms</h3>
    <p>Getting there is similar to what we did for Form Groups.  From the
        <a href="{% url "onlineforms:index" %}" target="_blank">main online forms page</a>, you can see the link to
        <a href="{% url "onlineforms:list_all" %}" target="_blank">Create/Edit Forms</a>.
    <img src="/static/images/forms/manage_forms.png"/>
    <p>The options will be similar to the ones for Form Groups.</p>
