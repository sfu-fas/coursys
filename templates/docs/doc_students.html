<h2 id="groups">Forming Groups</h2>
<p>If your instructor has asked you to form groups in CourSys, the procedure is:</p>
<ol>
<li>One group member should visit the course page and select: Manage Groups &rarr; Create New Group.</li>
<li>Give the group a name and select the activities the group will be working on together (depending on your instructor's plan for the group).</li>
<li>Invite the other members to join the group by giving their userid (whatever comes before @sfu.ca in their SFU email address).</li>
<li>The other members will need to log in and accept the invitation. If group members don't accept the invitation, they cannot submit work and <strong>may not receive grades</strong> for it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="group-submit">Submitting as a Group</h2>

<p>Any group member can submit the work on behalf of the group. Of course, your group should coordinate as necessary.</p>
<p>When another member of the group submits work on your behalf, you will receive a notification from CourSys.</p>
