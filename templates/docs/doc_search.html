<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;search&rdquo; box at the top-right of every page in {{ CourSys }} is usually ignored because users have come to assume it's useless. It isn't.</p>

<h2 id="fields">Things Searched</h2>
<p>The search will automatically search for any of these things that seem relevant:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>Courses you were in: students, TAs, and instructors can search for things like &ldquo;cmpt 120&rdquo; or &ldquo;programming&rdquo; to find course offerings.</li>
    <li>Course pages: anybody can search for content on course pages that are visible to them, e.g. &ldquo;software help&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Discussion: anybody can search for course discussion content, e.g. &ldquo;uploading problem&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Students in courses: instructors and TAs can search for students in their courses. This is likely the most useful search feature&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="student">Student Search</h2>
<p>The search for students in your courses is very powerful when trying to find a relevant student. For example:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>The student who just emailed me from example@sfu.ca: search &ldquo;example&rdquo; or &ldquo;example@sfu.ca&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>The student with a Gmail address but whose name is John Doe (or maybe Jonathan?): search &ldquo;John Doe&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>The student who goes by &ldquo;Tony Chan&rdquo; but has an official Chinese name I don't remember: search &ldquo;Tony Chan&rdquo; (if SIMS knows the preferred name).</li>
    <li>Um&hellip; his name is Frank and he is in CMPT&nbsp;120: search &ldquo;Frank 120&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Er&hellip; that girl named Sarah (or maybe it was Sara) who was in my class about two years ago: search &ldquo;Sarah {{ two_years }}&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Dammit&hellip; his name is Curtis&hellip; isn't that enough? Yes: search &ldquo;Curtis&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
