# Code Examples

It's time to expand our knowledge of the [Haskell standard library](+GHC_DOCS+html/libraries/index.html). For the rest of the exercise, we will use some of the date/time modules, which can be imported like this: (A Haskell import must be before any function definitions in the file.)
```hs
import Data.Time.Calendar
import Data.Time.Calendar.OrdinalDate
```

Code can be inline like `x=2` or block:
```
x=2
```

Or block with a language for syntax highlighting:
```py
x = 2
```
